*umdoc* is a Markdown to *LaTeX* to *PDF* converter.
It is small command line tool, which converts a Markdown file or set of Markdown files with optional layout information written in *LaTeX* into an input file (`.tex` file) for a *LaTeX* engine like `lualatex` or `pdflatex`. This file is then converted into a *PDF* document using such an engine.

## Example & Documentation

Further documentation and a showcase of *umdoc*'s capabilities can be found in its [user manual](https://github.com/craflin/umdoc/releases/download/0.1.2/umdoc-0.1.2.pdf).
